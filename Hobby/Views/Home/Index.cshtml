    <p class="lead">
        Dog walking is not only a fun hobby for me, but it's also a way for me to stay active and enjoy the outdoors. I love meeting new dogs and spending time with them while getting some exercise. Whether it's a stroll in the park or a quick jog around the neighborhood, it's always a rewarding experience.
